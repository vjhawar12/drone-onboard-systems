# Gemini2 Camera Feed – Vision Pipeline

Real-time vision pipeline for the **AEAC Fire Reconnaissance UAS Competition**, built around the **Orbbec Gemini 2 depth camera**.  
The system performs **color circle detection**, **depth alignment**, and **plane estimation** under real-world lighting and compression.

## What This Does

- Streams aligned color and depth from Orbbec Gemini 2  
- Detects colored circular targets using HSV segmentation  
- Estimates distance to detected objects  
- Fits dominant planes using RANSAC  
- Displays live overlays and debug views  

Designed to be robust to:
- MJPG compression
- Auto-exposure and white balance
- Lighting variation
- USB reconnects and transient frame failures

## High-Level Pipeline

1. Camera
   - Synchronized color and depth streams
   - Depth aligned to color
   - Automatic retry on frame failures

2. Color Segmentation
   - HSV thresholding per color
   - Gaussian blur for stability
   - Morphological operations (OPEN/CLOSE)

3. Circle Detection
   - Contour extraction
   - Geometric filtering (area, radius, solidity, roundness)
   - Rejects noise and irregular blobs

4. Plane Estimation
   - Depth to 3D point conversion
   - RANSAC plane fitting
   - Convex hull of inliers

5. Visualization
   - Live feed with overlays
   - Mask debug windows
   - Distance annotations

## Circle Detection Notes

- Not Hough-based
- Uses mask cleanup combined with contour geometry
- More robust to partial occlusion and noise
- Thresholds tuned for colored paper targets

Key techniques:
- HSV blur before thresholding
- Morphological CLOSE to fill gaps
- Morphological OPEN to remove speckle noise
